TSA3 — Answers, Explanations, and Screenshot Instructions

Overview
- This file collects the answers and explanations required for TSA3 and gives explicit screenshot instructions you can follow and capture.
- Recommended screenshot filenames are provided so you can attach them for submission.

Which SQL file to import in phpMyAdmin
- Use `scripts/dealership_seed.sql`.
  - Why: It creates the `ci4project` database, tables (`users`, `services`, `brands`, `positions`), and inserts a seeded admin user (email: `admin@example.com`, password: `password`).
  - How to import:
    1. Open phpMyAdmin and create or select the server connection.
    2. From the left column, click "New" and create database `ci4project` (optional — the file will also create it).
    3. Select the `ci4project` database and click the "Import" tab.
    4. Choose `dealership_seed.sql` from `scripts/` in your project and run the import.

Notes about the `users` table
- If you prefer to only create the DB schema and then register users manually, use `scripts/create_database.sql` followed by `scripts/users_table.sql`.
- `dealership_seed.sql` includes an admin account with a bcrypt hash (password `password`) for convenience.

What I changed in the project (improvements)
- Centralized brand colors into CSS variables in `public/css/style.css` (`--brand-primary`, `--brand-accent`, `--brand-bg`).
- Added `.bg-brand` and `.bg-beige` utility classes so templates don't use inline color styles.
- Adjusted `.brand-logo` sizing and rounded corners for better display across pages.
- Replaced inline nav and hero colors in `app/Views/templates/header.php` and `app/Views/site/home.php` to use the new classes.
- Improved hero overlay so text remains readable over the background image.

Screenshot guide (follow this exact order)
Save each screenshot with the filename in parentheses.

1. Registration page (GET) — empty form (`/register`) (screenshot: `01_register_get.png`).
   - Open `/register` and capture full page showing empty fields and heading.

2. Registration validation (errors) — submit empty or invalid fields and show errors (`/register`) (screenshot: `02_register_errors.png`).
   - Enter blank or invalid values and submit to capture validation messages.

3. Registration success — after valid register, capture flash message or dashboard (`/customer`) (screenshot: `03_register_success.png`).

4. Login page (GET) — empty form (`/login`) (screenshot: `04_login_get.png`).

5. Login validation — submit wrong credentials and show error (`/login`) (screenshot: `05_login_error.png`).

6. Customer dashboard — menu cards visible (`/customer`) (screenshot: `06_customer_dashboard.png`).

7. Customer profile — shows your own details (`/customer/profile`) (screenshot: `07_customer_profile.png`).

8. Admin dashboard — list of users table (`/admin`) (screenshot: `08_admin_index.png`).

9. Admin pagination — show pager links at bottom (`/admin` with multiple users) (screenshot: `09_admin_pagination.png`).

10. Admin edit user — open edit form for a user (`/admin/edit/{id}`) (screenshot: `10_admin_edit.png`).

11. Logout redirect — after clicking logout, landing on login (`/logout` -> `/login`) (screenshot: `11_logout.png`).

Screenshot tips
- Use a clean browser (incognito/private) or clear session to capture GET forms.
- Include the browser address bar or ensure the route is visible in the screenshot.
- Keep images named exactly as above for easy submission.

Additional optional screenshots (branding)
- Main homepage showing logo and brand color in navbar (`/`) (screenshot: `A_home_brand.png`).
- Hero section showing the overlay and CTA buttons (`/`) (screenshot: `A_hero_section.png`).

If you want a Word/.docx copy
- I saved this file as `docs/TSA3_answers_and_screenshots.md`. If you need a `.docx` I can produce one and add it to the project; tell me if you want `.docx` specifically.

Next steps I can do for you
- Create a real `.docx` file with the same content.
- Run a quick local test procedure checklist (how to run migrations, seeders, and start the app) and create a tiny `README_TSA3.md` with commands.
- Adjust more UI components to use the brand palette (buttons, cards, pager) — tell me which pages to update first.

---
Generated by the project assistant. If you want the `.docx` produced, say "Create docx" and I'll add it to `docs/`.

Incorporated Assignment Requirements & Submission Guidance

- The assignment requires a complete transactional website built with CodeIgniter 4 following MVC structure, implementing:
  - Form Validation
  - Session & Pagination
  - Email Sending
  - File Upload & Image Manipulation
  - Complete pages and transactions for each access level (Admin, User)
  - Use Bootstrap (or Tailwind) and make pages mobile responsive

- Submission format: a file upload (PDF and ZIP). Create a PDF containing the project documentation and screenshots; include source code in the ZIP.

Suggested Structure For Your Final PDF (adapted from course brief)
1. Title Page
   - Project title, course code (IT0049), name, student ID, date
2. Introduction
   - Brief description, problems solved, SDG alignment (e.g., SDG 9), development process and tools
3. Implementation Details (explain each feature with code snippets)
   - Form Validation — show key rules and an example snippet
   - Session & Pagination — explain session usage and how pagination is implemented
   - Email — show config and sample sending flow
   - File Upload & Image Manipulation — show upload config and any resizing/watermark steps
   - Landing Page and Access-Level Pages — explain differences and provide routes
   - Design Enhancements — Bootstrap usage and responsive choices (brand colors applied)
   - Include screenshots of working outputs (use the filenames provided in the screenshot guide above)
4. Reflection
   - What you learned, challenges faced, and how you overcame them
5. Appendix
   - Code snippets with concise explanations (not full code dumps)
   - CV (skills, achievements, education, contact info)

Repository Structure (recommended to include in your PDF)
```
project-root/
├─ app/        # CodeIgniter application folder (controllers, models, views, config)
├─ public/     # Public assets (CSS, JS, images)
├─ writable/   # Uploads, cache, logs
├─ scripts/    # SQL import files (e.g., dealership_seed.sql)
├─ docs/       # Documentation and screenshot guide
├─ composer.json
└─ README.md
```

Tips For Success (copy into PDF)
- Use comments in your code to explain logic.
- Make validation rules clear and secure.
- Implement server-side route protection and filters for admin pages.
- Use pagination for lists and ensure pager links are styled by theme.
- Configure email sending (SMTP) and test it.
- For file upload, allow image resizing or watermarking and validate file types.
- Apply Bootstrap for styling and test responsiveness on mobile.
- Test everything locally before submission and collect the required screenshots.

Submission Checklist (what to upload)
- A single PDF containing: Title, Introduction, Implementation Details, Screenshots, Reflection, Appendix.
- A ZIP archive of your full source code (exclude vendor or node_modules if large).
- Optional: a `.docx` copy of your PDF if requested.

If you want, I can now:
- Produce a `.docx` version of this `TSA3_answers_and_screenshots.md` and add it to `docs/`.
- Apply the brand colors to additional pages (e.g., admin pages, auth forms).
- Generate a short `README_TSA3.md` with exact commands to run migrations, seeders, and start the app.

Tell me which next step you'd like and I will proceed.
